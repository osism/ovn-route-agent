# HA failover scenario for the containerlab E2E harness.
#
# Goal (issue #105): with the lab green (baseline passing), simulate
# loss of the priority-30 master chassis (`gateway-1`). OVN must
# re-elect `cr-lr0-public` to the priority-20 chassis (`gateway-2`),
# BGP must withdraw the FIP /32s on the dead session and re-advertise
# them from the new master, and `client-1 → FIP` must resume within
# `FAILOVER_TIMEOUT` (default 30s).
#
# Implementation note — chassis loss simulation:
# The issue's "Action" line says `docker stop clab-${LAB}-gateway-1`.
# Containerlab wires the per-gateway underlay (gateway-N:eth1 ↔
# upstream:ethN) as veth pairs at deploy time; `docker stop` destroys
# the container's netns and with it BOTH ends of those veths. A
# follow-up `docker start` brings the container back but containerlab
# does not re-establish the link, so the master has no underlay, no
# BGP session, and the FIP advertisement never comes back — the test
# can't return the lab to baseline state and "3+ green runs in a row"
# is impossible without `make e2e-down && make e2e-up` between runs.
# Stop only ovn-controller via `ovn-ctl stop_controller` instead: it
# terminates cleanly on SIGTERM, releases its claim on cr-lr0-public,
# and OVN re-elects to the priority-20 chassis. The agent and FRR on
# the "lost" chassis keep running, so they observe the Port_Binding
# change and withdraw the FIP /32s from BGP themselves. Failback is
# `ovn-ctl start_controller` on the same node — no container restart,
# no veth re-create, no bootstrap re-run. The OVN HA mechanism under
# test (BFD-monitored re-election of cr-lr0-public) is identical;
# only the simulation of node death is softer.
#
# A note on why this is not SIGSTOP'ing ovn-controller: a frozen
# process still holds its SB claim. The release happens at clean
# shutdown via the SIGTERM handler, so re-election needs the process
# to actually exit.
#
# Strict variant (issue #131): when LOSS_BUDGET is set, the scenario
# additionally measures the data-plane outage. A 0.1s-spaced `ping`
# flood from CLIENT is captured with `tcpdump` on its eth1 across the
# re-election; the failover outage is the largest gap between
# consecutive ICMP echo replies and must stay within LOSS_BUDGET
# seconds. The pcap is written to ARTIFACTS_DIR for triage. The
# loss-measurement pattern follows issue #113 (`ping -i 0.1` +
# `tcpdump`). With LOSS_BUDGET unset the scenario behaves exactly as
# before.
#
# Pre-condition: the lab is up. When SANITY_GATE=1 (default) this
# scenario runs `baseline.sh` first so a broken green path is reported
# as a baseline regression instead of being attributed to failover.
#
# Teardown: ovn-controller on the master is resumed on EXIT (via
# trap). The script then waits up to FAILBACK_TIMEOUT seconds for
# `cr-lr0-public` to bind back to MASTER and for `client-1 → FIP`
# reachability to return, leaving the lab at baseline state. The CI
# workflow additionally invokes the teardown step with `if: always()`
# so a fatal interpreter error here (which skips the trap) is still
# cleaned up.
#
# Environment overrides (used by the CI workflow):
#   LAB                container-name prefix (defaults to the topology name "ovn-e2e")
#   FIP                target FIP to ping (defaults to the priority-30 chassis FIP)
#   CLIENT             source container (defaults to clab-${LAB}-client-1)
#   MASTER             chassis to fail (defaults to gateway-1, the priority-30 chassis)
#   CENTRAL            OVN central container (defaults to clab-${LAB}-central)
#   LR_PUBLIC_PORT     LR external port name (defaults to lr0-public)
#   FAILOVER_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for reachability to recover (default 30)
#   FAILBACK_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for the lab to return to baseline (default 60)
#   PING_COUNT         packets for the final reachability check (default 5)
#   PING_TIMEOUT       per-packet wait, passed to ping -W (default 2)
#   SANITY_GATE        run baseline.sh first when 1 (default 1)
#   LOSS_BUDGET        when set, run the strict variant and fail if the
#                      failover outage exceeds this many seconds
#                      (issue #131; default unset = strict variant off)
#   PROBE_INTERVAL     ping spacing for the strict-variant flood (default 0.1)
#   ARTIFACTS_DIR      when set, the strict-variant pcap is saved here
