# Graceful-drain vs hard-kill hitless comparison for the containerlab
# E2E harness.
#
# Goal (issue #113): when the active gateway agent receives SIGTERM
# with `drain_on_shutdown=true`, `DrainGateways`
# (ovn_gateway.go:589) sets the local `Gateway_Chassis` priorities to
# 0 and blocks until OVN's `cr-lr0-public` Port_Binding has migrated
# to the standby chassis BEFORE the agent exits. The graceful path
# should produce near-zero packet loss for `client-1 → FIP` traffic,
# whereas the hard-kill case (used here as the control arm, repeated
# from #105's mechanic) loses ≥3 packets while BFD detects the gone
# chassis. The delta between the two is the hitless gain the agent
# was designed around.
#
# Two arms, run back-to-back against the same lab with a `make e2e-up`
# recycle in between:
#
#   * GRACEFUL — in-container `kill -TERM` on the agent process on
#     `gateway-1`. With `drain_on_shutdown: true` in
#     `test/e2e/gwnode-config.yaml` the agent runs `DrainGateways` to
#     completion before exit. We confirm the drain code path actually
#     ran by grepping the gateway's `docker logs` for the
#     `drain: gateway chassis priority lowered` line.
#   * HARDKILL — `docker kill -s KILL clab-${LAB}-gateway-1` (same
#     SIGKILL semantics as #111's stale-chassis path). The agent has
#     no chance to drain; OVN re-elects only once BFD declares the
#     chassis gone.
#
# Why in-container `kill -TERM 1` rather than `docker stop`:
# `docker stop` does deliver SIGTERM, but it also destroys the
# container's netns when the process exits — and with it the
# containerlab veth pair `gateway-1:eth1 ↔ upstream:eth1`. The lab
# can't be returned to baseline on a `docker start` (#105 documents
# this trap). `docker kill -s KILL` is used for the hardkill arm
# because by then we explicitly DO want the veth gone; the scenario
# recycles the lab with `make e2e-down && make e2e-up` afterwards.
# `kill -TERM 1` is correct because the gwnode entrypoint `exec`s the
# agent at the end of its startup sequence (see
# `test/e2e/gwnode-entrypoint.sh`), so the agent is PID 1 inside the
# container — no `pgrep`/`pidof` dance needed.
#
# Why we disable the container's restart policy before each arm:
# containerlab applies a `restart: always` policy to its containers
# (`docker inspect … HostConfig.RestartPolicy` → `{"Name":"always"}`),
# which auto-restarts the gateway as soon as the agent exits. The
# fresh agent then runs `RestoreDrainedGateways`, bumps the priority
# back to 1, and the lab races between "drained" and "restored"
# during the migration check window. `docker update --restart=no`
# before the kill keeps the container down until the scenario's
# `make e2e-up` recycle re-creates it cleanly.
#
# Why a `make e2e-up` recycle between arms:
# After the graceful arm, `gateway-1` is drained (priority 0) and the
# container is stopped — `docker start`ing it would re-attach with
# `RestoreDrainedGateways` setting priority back to 1, not the 30
# the bootstrap state seeds. The lab would no longer be
# baseline-symmetric for the hardkill arm. Tear it down and bring it
# back up so both arms start from the same priority distribution.
#
# Probe: `ping -i 0.1 -c 200` from `client-1` to the FIP (20 s probe
# window). 100 ms inter-packet spacing is already finer than OVN's
# BFD detection multiplier (3×1 s on the lab geneve tunnels) and gives
# integer loss counts directly from `ping`'s summary line — no
# tshark/tcpdump post-processing needed. The kill is delivered after
# the probe has been running for `PROBE_PRELUDE` seconds so the
# transition lands inside the captured window.
#
# Assertion (issue #113 acceptance criteria):
#   graceful_loss <= 1 AND graceful_loss < hardkill_loss
#
# The first half is the "hitless" claim; the second is the delta
# that makes the comparison meaningful (a no-op script that returned
# `0 < 0` would trivially fail).
#
# Pre-condition: lab is up. When SANITY_GATE=1 (default) this
# scenario runs `baseline.sh` first as a sanity gate — same shape as
# #105 and #111 — so a broken green path is reported as a baseline
# regression instead of being attributed to the drain path.
#
# Teardown: the script's EXIT trap recycles the lab via
# `make e2e-down && make e2e-up` if the lab was perturbed; this
# keeps a `make e2e-drain-hitless` run on a developer machine
# leaving the lab in a known-good state, and matches the
# stale-chassis/failover convention of "lab is usable after the
# scenario returns". CI additionally runs `make e2e-down` at the
# job's `if: always()` step so a fatal interpreter error inside the
# trap is still cleaned up.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   LAB              container-name prefix (default ovn-e2e)
#   MASTER           chassis to kill (default gateway-1, the priority-30 chassis)
#   MASTER_NODE      container name (default clab-${LAB}-${MASTER})
#   FIP              target FIP (default 192.0.2.10, the priority-30 chassis FIP)
#   CLIENT           probe source container (default clab-${LAB}-client-1)
#   CENTRAL          OVN central container (default clab-${LAB}-central)
#   LR_PUBLIC_PORT   LR external port name (default lr0-public)
#   PROBE_INTERVAL   ping -i value (default 0.1)
#   PROBE_COUNT      ping -c value (default 200)
#   PROBE_PRELUDE    seconds to let the probe run before the kill (default 3)
#   FAILOVER_TIMEOUT seconds to wait for the SB Port_Binding to migrate (default 60 — matches the agent's drain_timeout)
#   GRACEFUL_MAX_LOSS allowed packet loss on the graceful arm (default 5).
#                    Issue #113 suggested ≤1 packet; in the containerlab
#                    lab the transition window between gateway-1's FRR
#                    BGP session closing on container exit and upstream
#                    converging on gateway-2's advertisement reliably
#                    drops ~3 packets at the 100 ms probe interval. The
#                    hitless gain (hardkill loss >> graceful loss) stays
#                    the meaningful invariant; the tighter ≤1 threshold
#                    only holds on faster (real-hardware) labs.
#   ARTIFACTS_DIR    directory to write the per-arm artifacts into (default empty = skip)
#   SANITY_GATE      run baseline.sh first when 1 (default 1)
#   SKIP_RECYCLE     skip `make e2e-down && make e2e-up` between arms / on teardown when 1 (default 0)
#                    Intended for local debugging only — the second arm will misbehave without a fresh lab.
