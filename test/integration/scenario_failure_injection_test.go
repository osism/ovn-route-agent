// Scenarios in this file cover #88 item 1: a transient failure of one of the
// three external tools the agent shells out to (vtysh, nft, ovs-ofctl)
// followed by self-heal on the next periodic reconcile. The shim helper
// (testenv.WithFailingTool) is the common substrate — each sub-scenario arms
// it at the moment that lets the agent observe the failure, then asserts the
// desired state arrives after the shim disarms itself.
//
// All scenarios in this file share the TestScenario_FailureInjection_ prefix
// so acceptance criterion #3 (no flakes on 10 consecutive runs of
// `go test -count=10 -tags=integration -run TestScenario_FailureInjection_`)
// can target the whole set with one -run argument.

// TestScenario_FailureInjection_VtyshFailsOnce (#88 item 1, vtysh sub-case):
//
// Arm vtysh to fail every call in the next reconcile cycle. The agent's
// initial reconcile then cannot install the FRR /32 route for a fresh FIP,
// but the next periodic tick — by which point the shim has exhausted its
// counter and disarmed — re-runs ensureRoutes and the route appears.
//
// We pick the shim's failCount high enough to also blow through verifyRoutes,
// which runs ListFRRRoutes and AddFRRRoutes again after the initial add. Three
// failures (List, Add, verify-List) is enough to keep FRR empty for the whole
// cycle; the fourth call (the second cycle's List) finds the counter zero and
// chains through to real vtysh.
//
// The kernel route is installed unconditionally — netlink doesn't go through
// the shim — so the test pins it down separately as a sanity check that only
// the FRR plane experienced the failure.

// installed at setup, so we induce a fresh `nft -f -` by deleting the table
// out-of-band and waiting for the next periodic reconcile to detect drift
// and re-apply. After the shim disarms (counter exhausted), the same
// reconcile succeeds and the table reappears.
//
// The "syntactically valid but semantically conflicting prior rule" the
