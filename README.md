# ovn-network-agent

Event-driven network agent for OVN-based OpenStack environments. A real-time
daemon that watches OVN databases directly via the OVSDB protocol to
synchronize Floating IP routes and optionally forward traffic from anycast
VIPs to internal backends.

To build the docs locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run docs:dev      # serve at http://localhost:5173
npm run docs:build    # static build in docs/.vitepress/dist
```

The Markdown sources live in `docs/`. Editing them and pushing to `main`
triggers the [Deploy Documentation](.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yaml)
workflow.

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.25+ (see `go.mod` for the exact minimum). Build the binary,
write a minimal config pointing at your OVN cluster, and run it:

```bash
make build

cat > /etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml <<EOF
ovn_sb_remote: "tcp:10.10.0.1:6642,tcp:10.10.0.2:6642,tcp:10.10.0.3:6642"
ovn_nb_remote: "tcp:10.10.0.1:6641,tcp:10.10.0.2:6641,tcp:10.10.0.3:6641"
EOF

sudo ./ovn-network-agent --config /etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml --log-level debug --dry-run
```

See the [tutorial](https://osism.github.io/ovn-network-agent/tutorials/first-agent)
for the full walkthrough.

## Origin

This agent is based on the shell script
[`ovn-network-agent.sh`](./contrib/ovn-network-agent.sh) which served as the
original prototype. The built-in veth VRF leak functionality
(`--veth-leak-enabled`) replaces the standalone script
[`veth-vrf-leak.sh`](./contrib/veth-vrf-leak.sh).
