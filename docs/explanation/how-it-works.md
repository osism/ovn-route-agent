# How the reconcile loop works

The agent monitors the OVN Southbound and Northbound databases and performs
targeted writes to both OVN NB (default routes, static MAC bindings) and the
local system (kernel routes, IP rules, FRR static routes, OVS flows on the
provider bridge).

1. **Connects** to OVN Southbound and Northbound databases via OVSDB IDL.
2. **Watches** for changes in real-time:
   - `Port_Binding` table (SB) — detects gateway chassis failover
     (chassisredirect changes bypass debouncing for fast reaction) and
     extracts SNAT IPs from `NatAddresses` on gateway patch ports for
     immediate route announcement before NB NAT entries exist.
   - `Chassis` table (SB) — detects chassis membership changes.
   - `NAT` table (NB) — detects Floating IP and SNAT assignments.
   - `Logical_Router` / `Logical_Router_Port` tables (NB) — maps NAT entries
     to their owning routers and auto-discovers provider network CIDRs from
     `Logical_Router_Port.Networks`.
3. **Sets up** the provider bridge at startup:
   - Adds a **link-local IP** to the bridge device so the kernel can perform
     ARP resolution.
   - Enables **proxy ARP** on the bridge device so the kernel responds to ARP
     requests for FIP addresses.
4. **Reacts** instantly to changes — for each router whose gateway is active
   on this chassis:
   - Ensures a **default route** (`0.0.0.0/0 via <virtual-gw>`) and **static
     MAC binding** in OVN NB so reply traffic exits the logical router
     correctly (see [Gatewayless provider networks](gatewayless-networks)).
   - Installs **OVS MAC-tweak flows** on the provider bridge so the kernel
     accepts packets from OVN (rewrites destination MAC to `br-ex` MAC).
   - Installs **OVS hairpin flows** (per FIP, priority 910) that reflect
     same-chassis cross-router traffic back into OVN via `output:in_port`,
     rewriting both source MAC (`br-ex` MAC) and destination MAC (owning
     router port MAC) — see
     [Hairpin OVS flows](gatewayless-networks#hairpin-ovs-flows-on-br-ex).
   - Applies the **active priority lead boost** to its `Gateway_Chassis`
     entries: when this chassis is active, its priority is raised to
     `max(max peer + 1, 2)` so a peer returning from drain (restored to 1)
     cannot trigger reverse failover — see
     [Priority semantics](gateway-drain#priority-semantics).
   - Reconciles **per-network veth-leak routes and policy rules** in the
     veth leak table (default 200) so SNAT reply traffic on the provider
     subnet crosses into `vrf-provider` for BGP delivery.
   - Ensures `/32` **kernel routes** (with IP rules when using a dedicated
     routing table) and **FRR static routes** in the VRF for each FIP, SNAT
     IP, router LRP gateway IP, and (independent of router locality)
     configured port-forward VIP.
   - If configured, reconciles the **FRR prefix-list** with
     `permit <network> ge 32 le 32` entries for each discovered provider
     network.
   - If no routers are locally active: removes all managed routes (port
     forward VIPs still get kernel/FRR routes if any are configured).
5. **Port forwarding (DNAT)** — optionally forwards traffic from anycast VIP
   addresses (on a loopback interface in the VRF) to internal backends.
   Supports multiple backends per rule with sticky source-IP hashing
   (`jhash`) for consistent client-to-backend mapping. Client IPs are
   preserved using connmark-based return routing through the veth pair.
   Backends on the same host are handled via dedicated OUTPUT chains
   (`output_ctzone`, `output_fwmark`) since locally-delivered traffic
   bypasses the FORWARD/POSTROUTING path. Per-rule `masquerade` control
   allows mixing local and remote backends on the same VIP. Two
   source-selective hairpin fixes are available: `hairpin_masquerade: true`
   covers FIPs on the same node (matches the provider CIDR), and
   `router_masquerade: true` covers instances behind a router without a FIP
   (matches the specific router SNAT IPs discovered from OVN). Both leave
   unrelated external clients unaffected and can be combined on the same VIP.
   A `forward_veth_guard` nftables chain restricts the veth return path to
   legitimate traffic only. Requires `nft` binary and `veth_leak_enabled:
   true`.
6. **Reconciles** periodically as a safety net (default: every 60s).
7. **Detects stale chassis** — when a node dies without graceful shutdown,
   surviving agents detect its chassis disappearing from the SB Chassis
   table and clean up its managed OVN NB entries (static routes and MAC
   bindings) after a configurable grace period (default: 5m, configurable
   via `stale_chassis_grace_period`, set to `0` to disable). Random jitter
   (0-30s) prevents multiple agents from cleaning up simultaneously.
8. **Drains gateways** on shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM) — before cleanup, the
   agent lowers its `Gateway_Chassis` priority to 0 in OVN NB, causing
   `ovn-northd` to migrate chassisredirect ports to standby chassis (priority
   >= 1). On the next startup, drained entries are restored to priority 1
   (standby level). The active chassis automatically maintains a minimum
   priority of 2 (above all possible standby peers) during reconciliation,
   preventing reverse failover even when a peer restores to priority 1. This
   eliminates the traffic disruption window between BGP route withdrawal and
   OVN BFD failover detection (see [Gateway drain mode](gateway-drain)).
   Enabled by default (`drain_on_shutdown: true`, `drain_timeout: 60s`).
9. **Cleans up** after drain — removes all managed routes, OVS flows, and
   the bridge IP before exiting (configurable via `cleanup_on_shutdown`).
