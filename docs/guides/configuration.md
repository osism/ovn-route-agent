# Configure the agent

Settings are loaded with the following priority (highest wins):

**CLI flags > environment variables > config file > defaults**

For the full list of every flag, env var, and config key, see the
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration).

## Config file (YAML)

```bash
ovn-network-agent --config /etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml
# or via environment variable
OVN_NETWORK_CONFIG=/etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml ovn-network-agent
```

See
[`ovn-network-agent.yaml.sample`](https://github.com/osism/ovn-network-agent/blob/main/ovn-network-agent.yaml.sample)
for a full example.

## Example

Config file `/etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml` with the base settings:

```yaml
ovn_sb_remote: "tcp:10.10.0.1:6642,tcp:10.10.0.2:6642,tcp:10.10.0.3:6642"
ovn_nb_remote: "tcp:10.10.0.1:6641,tcp:10.10.0.2:6641,tcp:10.10.0.3:6641"

# Optional: provider networks are auto-discovered from OVN when omitted
# network_cidr:
#   - "192.0.2.0/24"
#   - "198.51.100.0/24"
```

Run with the config file, overriding log level and enabling dry-run via CLI
flags:

```bash
ovn-network-agent --config /etc/ovn-network-agent/config.yaml --log-level debug --dry-run
```

CLI flags take precedence over values in the config file.

## Operating modes

The agent runs in one of two modes, derived automatically from the
configuration — there is no mode flag:

| `ovn_sb_remote` / `ovn_nb_remote` | `port_forwards` | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| both set | any | **full mode** |
| both empty | non-empty | **port-forward-only mode** |
| both empty | empty | error — nothing to do |
| exactly one set | any | error — incomplete OVN configuration |

The active mode is logged in the startup banner (`mode=full` or
`mode=port-forward-only`).

### Full mode

The default. The agent connects to the OVN Southbound and Northbound
databases, synchronises Floating IP routes, manages gateway routing, and
also serves any configured `port_forwards`.

### Port-forward-only mode

When `port_forwards` is configured but **both** OVN remotes are left unset,
the agent runs as a standalone VIP service: it manages only the configured
port-forward VIPs — DNAT rules, VIP addresses, connmark return routing, and
FRR static routes for BGP announcement — and never connects to OVN.

Use this for a node that should only expose configured VIPs (for example a
DNS resolver, monitoring collector, or API proxy) and is not an OVN gateway
chassis. Such a node needs no provider bridge (`br-ex`), no FIPs, and no
gateway routing.

Two masquerade options depend on OVN-derived state and are therefore
rejected at startup in port-forward-only mode:

- `router_masquerade` — router SNAT IPs are discovered from OVN; without an
  OVN connection there is no source for them.
- `hairpin_masquerade` — requires an explicit `network_cidr`, because
  provider CIDRs are normally auto-discovered from OVN.

```yaml
# Port-forward-only config: no OVN remotes, only port_forwards.
port_forwards:
  - vip: "198.51.100.10"
    manage_vip: true
    rules:
      - proto: tcp
        port: 443
        dest_addr: "10.0.0.100"
```

Switching modes at runtime is not supported — it requires a restart.

## Prerequisites

- **OVN** (full mode only): TCP access to OVN Southbound and Northbound
  databases on the control nodes (the agent runs on network/gateway nodes
  where no local DB sockets exist). Not needed in port-forward-only mode.
- **FRR**: `vtysh` must be available and the VRF + BGP configuration must
  already exist.
- **Linux**: provider bridge (e.g. `br-ex`) must exist in full mode;
  port-forward-only mode does not use it.
- **VRF route leaking**: the agent automatically creates and manages a veth
  pair connecting the default VRF to `vrf-provider` (enabled by default via
  `--veth-leak-enabled`). Per-network routes are reconciled dynamically based
  on auto-discovered or configured provider networks.
- **nftables**: `nft` binary must be in `PATH` (required for port forwarding /
  DNAT).
- **Permissions**: root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` for netlink route manipulation.
