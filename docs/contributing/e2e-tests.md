# Containerlab E2E harness

The containerlab-based end-to-end test environment lives under
[`test/e2e/`](https://github.com/osism/ovn-network-agent/tree/main/test/e2e)
and is the foundation laid out by issue
[#44](https://github.com/osism/ovn-network-agent/issues/44) (parent
issue [#39](https://github.com/osism/ovn-network-agent/issues/39)).

It is the **infrastructure** layer only — image build files, the
containerlab topology, and a bootstrap script that seeds the OVN NB
DB. Scenario tests on top of this harness are tracked in follow-up
issues.

## Layout

```
test/e2e/
  Dockerfile.gwnode         — Ubuntu 24.04 + OVS + ovn-controller + FRR + agent
  Dockerfile.central        — ovn-northd + NB/SB ovsdb-server
  gwnode-entrypoint.sh      — starts OVS / ovn-controller / FRR, then execs the agent
  gwnode-config.yaml        — default agent config baked into the gwnode image
  central-entrypoint.sh     — starts ovn-northd + ovsdb-server, exposes 6641/6642
  topology.clab.yml         — containerlab topology (central + 3 gateways + upstream + 2 clients)
  bootstrap.sh              — idempotent OVN NB seed (1 LS, 1 LR with 2 FIPs, HA across 3 chassis)
```

## Prerequisites

- Linux host with Docker (privileged mode for containerlab containers).
- [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/install/) ≥ 0.55.
- `make`, `docker buildx`, and a Go toolchain matching `go.mod` (the
  gwnode image builds the agent from source).

`make e2e-install-tools` bootstraps containerlab on Linux via the
upstream installer (`get.containerlab.dev`); it is a no-op when
`containerlab` is already on PATH.

macOS is **not** a supported host for containerlab itself — upstream
ships no darwin binary. The supported macOS workflow is to run the
lab from a Linux VM (OrbStack, Colima, Docker Desktop's Linux VM,
etc.); see the upstream guide at
<https://containerlab.dev/macos/>. `make e2e-install-tools` exits
with an explanatory error on macOS instead of pretending to install
something.

The lab also runs on a GitHub Actions `ubuntu-latest` runner without
extra setup: Docker is preinstalled and supports privileged
containers, which is what containerlab requires.

```

- The **management** network is the default containerlab bridge;
  every node has an `eth0` on it. The gateway agents reach
  `central:6642` (OVN SB) and `central:6641` (OVN NB) here.
- The **underlay** is a set of point-to-point links:
  `gateway-N:eth1 ↔ upstream:eth{1,2,3}`. BGP between the gateways
  and the upstream router runs over these links. No real BGP session
  is required for the lab to come up — FRR may stay idle.
- The two **clients** sit behind the upstream router
  (`upstream:eth4` and `upstream:eth5`) and are used as reachability
  probes for scenario-level tests.

## Bootstrap state

`bootstrap.sh` seeds the NB DB with:

- one logical switch `ls0` (`192.168.10.0/24`),
- one logical router `lr0` with two ports:
  `lr0-ls0` (`192.168.10.1/24`) and `lr0-public` (`192.0.2.1/24`),
- a Gateway_Chassis distribution on `lr0-public`:
  `gateway-1` priority 30, `gateway-2` priority 20,
  `gateway-3` priority 10,
- two `dnat_and_snat` NATs (FIPs):
  `192.0.2.10 ↔ 192.168.10.10` and
  `192.0.2.11 ↔ 192.168.10.11`.

The script is idempotent; running it twice produces no further state
changes.

## Running locally

From the repository root:

```sh
make e2e-up          # build images + containerlab deploy + bootstrap
# … exercise the lab …
make e2e-down        # containerlab destroy
```

Equivalent manual sequence (useful for triage):

```sh
docker build -f test/e2e/Dockerfile.central -t ovn-network-agent/central:e2e .
docker build -f test/e2e/Dockerfile.gwnode  -t ovn-network-agent/gwnode:e2e  .

sudo containerlab deploy   -t test/e2e/topology.clab.yml
./test/e2e/bootstrap.sh

# Inspect the agent on gateway-1:
docker exec clab-ovn-e2e-gateway-1 ovn-network-agent --help
docker exec clab-ovn-e2e-gateway-1 ovs-vsctl show

# Inspect OVN central:
docker exec clab-ovn-e2e-central ovn-nbctl show

sudo containerlab destroy -t test/e2e/topology.clab.yml --cleanup
```

## Image-size budget

The acceptance criteria require the gwnode image to stay under
**600 MB**. The Dockerfile keeps the build slim by:

- using `--no-install-recommends` for every apt install,
- aggressively purging `software-properties-common` after the
  `cloud-archive:flamingo` PPA is registered,
- removing `/var/lib/apt/lists`, `/var/cache/apt/archives`,
  `/usr/share/doc`, `/usr/share/man`, `/usr/share/locale` after
  install,
- copying only the statically-linked agent binary from the Go build
  stage.

Check the resulting size with:

```sh
docker image inspect ovn-network-agent/gwnode:e2e \
    --format '{{.Size}}' | numfmt --to=iec --suffix=B
```

## Multi-architecture builds

The Go build stage in `Dockerfile.gwnode` honours `TARGETARCH`, and
the Ubuntu/OVS/OVN/FRR packages used at runtime are published for
both `amd64` and `arm64`. Multi-arch publication requires the
`docker-buildx-plugin` (on Debian/Ubuntu Docker CE hosts:
`sudo apt-get install -y docker-buildx-plugin`). Once it is
installed:

```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -f test/e2e/Dockerfile.gwnode -t ovn-network-agent/gwnode:e2e --push .
```

The `make e2e-up` target only builds for the host platform via plain
`docker build`, which is the right default for local development and
CI on a single runner and does not need the buildx plugin.
