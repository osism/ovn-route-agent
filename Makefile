# recover within FAILOVER_TIMEOUT (default 30s). Mirrors the step the

# tearing the lab down.

# Run the same-chassis hairpin scenario (issue #108) against a lab
# that is already up. Adds a second FIP backend (ls0-vm2 / 192.0.2.12)
# co-located on the active master, asserts the agent installs the
# OpenFlow hairpin rule (cookie 0x998) on br-ex for both FIPs, and
# pings the new FIP from the existing workload netns to exercise the
# hairpin data path end-to-end. Mirrors the step the CI workflow runs;
# the scenario's own EXIT trap removes the second FIP so a subsequent
# `make e2e-baseline` works without tearing the lab down.

# Run the port-forward / DNAT scenario (issue #109) against a lab
# that is already up. Adds an OVN Load_Balancer for 192.0.2.50:80 →
# ls0-vm1:8080 on lr0, starts a tiny HTTP backend in the existing vm1
# netns, curls the VIP from client-1, and asserts the backend log
# records client-1's underlay IP — i.e. OVN performed pure DNAT with
# no SNAT on the way in. Mirrors the step the CI workflow runs; the
# scenario's own EXIT trap removes the Load_Balancer, the per-chassis
# kernel route, the upstream static route, and the backend process,
# so a subsequent `make e2e-baseline` keeps passing.

# Run the port-forward hairpin scenario (issue #110) against a lab that
# is already up. Adds a co-located workload (vmc behind FIP_C on
# gateway-1) and a tenant-shim OVS internal port that gives the
# chassis kernel a routed path into ls0, then drives two phases
# against the agent's `hairpin_masquerade` flag: phase 1 (off) must
# time out because the backend reply bypasses the chassis conntrack,
# phase 2 (on) must succeed because the masquerade rule re-routes the
# reply through the chassis. Each phase restarts the gateway-1
# container so the agent reloads its config; the scenario's own EXIT
# trap restores the baseline agent config and removes every NB/kernel
# row added here so a subsequent `make e2e-baseline` keeps passing.

# Run the stale-chassis cleanup scenario (issue #111) against a lab
# that is already up. Hard-kills the priority-30 chassis (SIGKILL, no
# graceful agent shutdown) and asserts that NB rows tagged for the
# dead chassis are removed by surviving peers within
# stale_chassis_grace_period + a margin for jitter and reconcile
# cadence. Mirrors the step the CI workflow runs; the scenario's own
# EXIT trap restarts the killed chassis and waits for baseline-green.
